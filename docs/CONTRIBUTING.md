1. **üêõ Bug Reports** - Help us identify and fix issues
2. **üí° Feature Requests** - Suggest new functionality
3. **üìù Code Contributions** - Implement features or fixes
4. **üìñ Documentation** - Improve guides and API docs
5. **üß™ Testing** - Write tests or test new features
6. **üé® Design** - UI/UX improvements and accessibility enhancements
7. **üåç Localization** - Translate the extension to other languages

### Getting Started

#### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/branestawm-cos-ext.git
cd branestawm-cos-ext

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/branestawm-cos-ext.git
```

#### 2. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development build
npm run dev

# Open Chrome and load unpacked extension from ./build directory
```

#### 3. Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (recommended during development)
npm run test:watch

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and our custom linter for consistent code style:

```bash
# Check code style
npm run lint

# Auto-fix style issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

#### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards
- **ES2020+** features encouraged
- **TypeScript** preferred for new modules
- **JSDoc** comments for all public functions
- **Descriptive** variable and function names
- **No console.log** in production code (use logger instead)

#### Security Requirements
- **Always escape user input** using `SecurityUtils.escapeHtml()`
- **Validate data** before processing
- **Use safe DOM methods** (textContent over innerHTML)
- **Never use eval()** or similar unsafe functions

### Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
git commit -m "feat(tasks): add pause/resume functionality"
git commit -m "fix(security): escape HTML in task renderer"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for task extraction"
```

#### Commit Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style/formatting
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **security**: Security improvements

### Branch Naming
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/task-pause-resume
feature/accessibility-improvements

# Bug fix branches
fix/xss-vulnerability
fix/memory-leak

# Documentation branches
docs/api-reference
docs/contributing-guide
```

## üß™ Testing

### Writing Tests

We use our custom test framework. Here's how to write tests:

```javascript
// tests/example.test.js
test('should do something correctly', () => {
    const result = someFunction('input');
    expect(result).toBe('expected');
});

test('should handle async operations', async () => {
    const result = await asyncFunction();
    expect(result).toBeTruthy();
});

test('should throw on invalid input', () => {
    expect(() => functionThatShouldThrow()).toThrow();
});
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **New features** must include tests
- **Bug fixes** should include regression tests
- **Critical paths** require comprehensive test coverage
- **Security functions** need thorough validation tests

### Running Specific Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests for specific module
node test-runner.js tests/task-extractor.test.js

# Run with debugging
DEBUG=true npm test
```

## üìñ Documentation

### Code Documentation
- **JSDoc** for all public APIs
- **Inline comments** for complex logic
- **README updates** for new features
- **Architecture docs** for significant changes

```javascript
/**
 * Extract potential tasks from message content
 * @param {string} messageContent - The message text to analyze
 * @param {Object} options - Extraction options
 * @param {number} options.maxTasks - Maximum tasks to extract (default: 3)
 * @returns {Array<PotentialTask>} Array of potential tasks with confidence scores
 */
extractPotentialTasks(messageContent, options = {}) {
    // Implementation...
}
```
